## 6.1. Introduction and Best-Subset Selection

When we have a big P (predictors) we are going to choose the most important predictors and the fit the least squares using the most important predictors.
How to find the best subsets selection?
- Step 1 - Let Mo be the null model   y0 = B0
- Step 2 - For k=1,2,...,*Pn* (for each of these predictors fit all ![](https://i.imgur.com/z0bUEFb.png) models that contain exactly **K** predictors.
  - K = 1
